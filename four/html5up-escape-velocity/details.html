The production of net, also called limited thread work, has been practiced by many peoples, particularly in Africa and Peru. Examples of prehistoric textiles are extremely rare because of the perishability of fabrics. The earliest evidence of weaving, closely related to basketry, dates from Neolithic cultures of about 5000 BCE. Weaving apparently preceded spinning of yarn; woven fabrics probably originated from basket weaving. Cotton, silk, wool, and flax fibres were used as textile materials in ancient Egypt; cotton was used in India by 3000 BCE; and silk production is mentioned in Chinese chronicles dating to about the same period. The history of spinning technology will be touched on below in the section Production of yarn: Spinning and that of weaving technology in the section Production of fabric.

                Early fabrics
                
                Many fabrics produced by the simple early weaving procedures are of striking beauty and sophistication. Design and art forms are of great interest, and the range of patterns and colours is wide, with patterns produced in different parts of the world showing distinctive local features.
                
                Yarns and cloth were dyed and printed from very early times. Specimens of dyed fabrics have been found in Roman ruins of the 2nd century BCE; tie-and-dye effects decorated the silks of China in the Tang dynasty (618â€“907 CE); and there is evidence of production of printed textiles in India during the 4th century BCE. Textiles found in Egypt also indicate a highly developed weaving craft by the 4th century CE, with many tapestries made from linen and wool. Persian textiles of very ancient origin include materials ranging from simple fabrics to luxurious carpets and tapestries.
